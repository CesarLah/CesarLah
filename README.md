## âš¡ Data Scientist
#### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub account!

Hi there! Here I will explain what my skills are and some facts about myself.

I've gained the tools and experience needed to be a Data Scientist thanks to my __MSc__, __Data Science Bootcamp__, __online courses__, and __self-learning__ with the *"Data Science from Scratch"* book by O'Reilly.

As you can check along my repositories, my most important programming skills are (in order of experience):
1. ***Python***. Including modules such as ***Matplotlib***, ***NumPy***, ***Scikit-learn***, ***SpaCy***, ***Pandas*** or ***Sqlite***. I successfully have done different projects in Python and I can consider it the programming language where I feel more confident coding in.
2. ***C/C++***. Learned during the realization of my MSc and during the project ***"Meto"*** to program the Arduino board.
3. ***Matlab***. Where I can do integrations, derivations, visualizations and many other things thanks to the numerous toolboxes they provide.
4. ***JavaScript, HTML5, CCS***. I have done some little projects in this languages and I will be uploading them to my account ASAP.

I do mainly functional programming and I have some experience with OOP too.

###### I'm currently working on learning new techniques to make visualizations more interesting to the eye of the reader, as well as getting experience managing datasets. I will keep my GitHub updated, so have a look frequently to see my progress! ðŸ˜Š
